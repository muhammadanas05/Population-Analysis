# Population Data Analysis

This project analyzes population data through various visualizations to understand the distribution of populations across countries, age groups, and genders. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle.

## Datasets

The analysis uses the following datasets:

1. Population Data: Contains global population data by country and year.
2. Country Metadata: Provides metadata about the countries in the dataset.
3. Indicator Metadata: Contains metadata about the indicators used in the dataset.

## Data Preparation

### Loading Data

The datasets are loaded into pandas DataFrames:

- `population_data`: Population data by country.
- `country_metadata`: Metadata about each country.
- `indicator_metadata`: Metadata about the indicators used.

### Data Cleaning

- Focus on Year 2020: The data is filtered to focus on the year 2020.
- Cleaning: Missing values are removed, and population values are converted to integers.

## Visualizations

### Top 20 Countries by Population

A bar chart visualizes the top 20 countries by population in 2020. This chart highlights the most populous countries.

### Population Distribution by Age Group

A bar chart displays the distribution of the population across different age groups, providing insights into the age demographics.

### Population Distribution by Gender

A bar chart shows the population distribution by gender, illustrating the proportion of males, females, and other genders.

### Age Distribution Histogram

A histogram of age distribution is created using random age data to visualize the frequency of different ages within a population.

## Results

- Top 20 Countries by Population: Identifies the countries with the highest populations in 2020.
- Age Distribution: Displays the spread of the population across various age groups.
- Gender Distribution: Highlights the distribution of the population by gender.
- Age Distribution Histogram: Provides a visual representation of age frequencies.
